### PacLED64 / Nano-LED / I-Pac Ultimate I/O Functions

#### Introduction:

The PacLED64 can be controlled in direct or script mode. When the board is powered up, it will check if a script is present in flash and if so, will begin to run it. This will happen on power-up (USB and LED power required) and before the host has initialized the USB bus.

Scripts are repeated continuously.

When sending commands to be stored in a script, it is usual to start the script with a SetLEDFadeTime and a SetScriptStepDelay otherwise the script will run in an unpredictable way.

When a first command is sent from the host, the script stops running and the command is processed.

Additionally, when the first command is sent, the Fade Time is set to zero.

**The following commands can be sent in script or direct mode:**

`bool Pac64SetLEDIntensities(int id, byte *data);`

- Sets the LED intensities on the device specified by id
- Data is an array of byte data (60 bytes for Nano-LED, 64 bytes for PacLED64 and 96 bytes for I-Pac Ultimate I/O)
- Byte values are from 0 to 255 (0 being off and 255 being full intensity)

**NOTE:** This is a long command and requires a delay of 20ms before sending any further command. This command should only be used when more than half the LEDs need to be changed. Do not use for setting a small number of LEDs, use _SetLEDIntensity_ for this instead.

`bool Pac64SetLEDIntensity(int id, int port, byte intensity);`

- Sets an LED's intensity on the device specified by id
- Port is the LED number
- Intensity is a value from 0 to 255 (0 being off and 255 being full intensity)

**NOTE:** In many applications this is the only command required, with the possible addition of one initial "_SetLEDFadeTime_". The other commands are mainly provided for compact script sizes.

`bool Pac64SetLEDStates(int id, int group, byte data);`

- Sets LED states on the device specified by `id`
- `group` specifies the LED group as follows:

| Group Number | LED Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 - 8 |
| 2 | 9 - 16 |
| 3 | 17 - 24 |
| 4 | 25 - 32 |
| 5 | 33 - 40 |
| 6 | 41 - 48 |
| 7 | 49 - 56 |
| 8 | 57 - 64 |
| 9 | 65 - 72 |
| 10 | 73 - 80 |
| 11 | 81 - 88 |
| 12 | 89 - 96 |

- `data` specifies LED states. Each bit represents an LED state (Eg. 0xFF = all enabled, 0x0 = all off, 0xAA = every second LED enabled)
- Returns true for success and false for failure

**NOTE:** "Enabled" means "set to its previously stored brightness setting from earlier `SetLEDIntensity` command.

`bool Pac64SetLEDState(int id, int group, int port, bool state);`

- Sets a single LED state on the device specified by `id`
- `port` is the LED number within a group
- `group` specifies the LED group as follows:

| Group Number | LED Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 - 8 |
| 2 | 9 - 16 |
| 3 | 17 - 24 |
| 4 | 25 - 32 |
| 5 | 33 - 40 |
| 6 | 41 - 48 |
| 7 | 49 - 56 |
| 8 | 57 - 64 |
| 9 | 65 - 72 |
| 10 | 73 - 80 |
| 11 | 81 - 88 |
| 12 | 89 - 96 |

- `state` is the LED value (true = enabled, or false = off)
**NOTE:** "Enabled" means "set to its previously stored brightness setting from earlier `SetLEDIntensity` command.

`bool Pac64SetLEDStatesRandom(int id);`

- Sets all LED's to random states on the device specified by id

`bool Pac64SetLEDFadeTime(int id, byte fadeTime);`

- Sets the LED's fade time on the device specified by id. This value is remembered by the board and used for all subsequent LED commands.

`bool Pac64SetScriptStepDelay(int id, byte stepDelay);`

- Sets the script step delay on the device specified by id

`bool Pac64SetLEDFlashSpeeds(int id, byte flashSpeed);`

- Sets all LED's flash speed on the device specified by id
- `flashspeed` is the speed of the flash (0 = always on, 1 = 2 secs, 2 = 1 sec, 3 = 0.5 sec)

`bool Pac64SetLEDFlashSpeed(int id, int port, byte flashSpeed);`

- Sets one LED's flash speed on the device specified by id
- `port` is the LED number
- `flashspeed` is the speed of the flash (0 = always on, 1 = 2 secs, 2 = 1 sec, 3 = 0.5 sec)

**The following commands are direct-mode only and cannot be incorporated in a script:**

`bool Pac64StartScriptRecording(int id);`

- Starts recording a script on the device specified by id. All subsequently-sent commands will be stored in the script and then executed at power-on. Max script length is 32 steps.

`bool Pac64StopScriptRecording(int id);`

- Stops recording a script on the PacLED64 specified by id. At the end of the script, the device inserts a "goto start" so the script is looped when executed at power-on.

`bool Pac64RunScript(int id);`

- Runs the script on the PacLED64 specified by id (This also occurs at power-on).

`bool Pac64ClearFlash(int id);`

- Clears the flash on the PacLED64 specified by id. Any saved script will no longer be run at power-on.

`bool Pac64SetDeviceId(int id, int newId);`

- Sets the Device Id on the PacLED64 specified by id (1 to 4).

### U-HID Functions

`bool PacProgramUHid(int id, char *sFilePath);`

- Programs a U-HID device using a .raw file exported from U-Config
- Returns true for success and false for failure

`bool PacSetServoStik4Way();`

- Sets a ServoStik to 4-Way mode
- Returns true for success and false for failure

`bool PacSetServoStik8Way();`

- Sets a ServoStik to 8-Way mode
- Returns true for success and false for failure

### USB Button Functions

`bool USBButtonConfigurePermanent(int id, byte *data);`

- Programs a USB Button device and stores is permanently in memory
- Returns true for success and false for failure

`bool USBButtonConfigureTemporary(int id, byte *data);`

## Examples in C++

- Set every second LED on the first Pacdrive device

```
int deviceCount = PacInitialize();

PacSetLEDStates(0, 0xAAAA);

PacShutdown();
```

- Set the second LED on

`PacSetLEDState(0, 1, true);`

- Output the full device path of the first device

```
char sDevicePath[256];

PacGetDevicePath(0, sDevicePath);

printf("%s\n", sDevicePath);
```

- Program the U-HID

`PacProgramUHid(0, "C:\Settings.raw");`
